      <p>
        I was born in Seoul, South Korea but my family immigrated to California when I was just 3 years old. Even though
        I
        spent a majority of my life in the US and only attended American schools, I am still fluent in Korean as it is
        my
        birth tongue and the language we use at home. At my internship at 3i Inc. in Seoul last summer, I had no
        problems
        communicating in Korean, even in a formal work setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating from high school in 2018, I attended the University of Washington-Seattle as a pre-science
        major,
        which is essentially undeclared but within the sciences field. During my sophomore year, I applied to the UW
        Informatics major as well as to transfer admission to University of California schools just to open up my
        options.
        Though I was accepted to the UW iSchool Informatics major, I ended up transferring to the University of
        California-Davis as a Computer Science major after taking multiple factors into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a Silicon Valley, CA based software developer and recent graduate from UC Davis with a B.S. in
        Computer Science. I am seeking full-time employment as a full-stack software developer / engineer. In my free
        time, I am studying deeper computer science topics and practicing the skills I learn in the form of small
        personal
        projects

            <p>I love discovering new places to eat. I keep all the delicious restaurants I've been to bookmarked and
              have an album in my phone dedicated to pictures of my favorite foods! My favorite right now would have to
              be hot pot, especially Korean and Japanese style. I also enjoy cooking which helps with my current gym
              grind.</p>

            <p>It was difficult to workout regularly while in school, but now I am going 6 days a week. Currently, I
              wake up at 7 am every morning for a 1.5-2 hour workout session and try to sleep at 12 am in order to
              maintain a healthy sleep cycle. Hopefully I'll be able to share some progress pictures once I'm a bit more
              confident.

            <p>I've always loved sports and played them my whole life. I played tennis and
              soccer competitively up until middle and high school respectively. I also played intramural soccer at UC
              Davis. Nowadays, I enjoy recreationally playing any sport I can including soccer, tennis, golf, bowling,
              snowboarding, and pool. </p>

            <p>My music tastes are a little tricky to describe and I haven't met many others who share the same tastes.
              I almost exclusively listen to Korean hip-hop. Where it gets difficult to describe is when the Korean
              artists I like start mixing in other genres. Some of my favorite songs could be described as Korean
              hip-hop with a little rock influence.</p>
